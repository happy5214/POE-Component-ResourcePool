=head1 NAME

POE::Component::ResourcePool::Resource::TryList - Delegate to a number of
resources.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use POE::Component::ResourcePool::Resource::TryList;

	my $good = POE::Component::ResourcePool::Resource::Good->new( ... );

	my $better = POE::Component::ResourcePool::Resource::Better->new( ... );

	my $best = POE::Component::ResourcePool::Resource::TryList->new(
		resources => [ $better, $good ],
	);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class allows you to specify fallback lists for resources easily.

The resources will be delegated to appropriately.

The only difference is that sometimes resources that return false from
C<could_allocate> will still have C<try_allocating> called on them, because the
try list only requires that one of the sub resources return true from
C<could_allocate>.

It is trivial to subclass and override it such that C<could_allocate> only
returns true if all the sub resources do, thus resolving this issue. However,
this seems to have a diminished practical value to me.
